# FitFlow AI

Welcome to FitFlow AI, a modern fitness application designed to revolutionize your fitness journey. This project aims to create a seamless experience for users to achieve their fitness goals. Below, you'll find details about the project, the technologies employed, and the learning goals achieved during its development.

## About the Project

FitFlow AI is a comprehensive fitness application that integrates various features to enhance your workout and nutrition routines. 

## Key functionalities include:


**Recipe Generation**: Access a vast database of healthy recipes tailored to your dietary preferences and fitness goals.

**Workout Tracking**: Record and monitor your exercise routines, allowing you to track progress and stay motivated.

**Eating Log Tracking**: Log your daily meals and nutritional intake to maintain a healthy and balanced diet.

**Pose Estimation-Based Form Analysis**: Receive real-time feedback on your workout poses to ensure proper form to maximize the effectiveness of your exercises and reduce the likelihood of injury. 

## Technologies Used

FitFlow AI is built on a robust technology stack to deliver a smooth and efficient user experience:

React: A modern JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a responsive and interactive front end.

Go (Golang): A powerful and efficient programming language used for building the backend infrastructure, ensuring high-performance server-side operations.

PostgreSQL: A reliable and scalable relational database management system for data persistence.

Docker: Containerization technology used to streamline deployment and ensure consistent environments across different platforms.

## API Used

FitFlow AI leverages external APIs to enhance its capabilities and provide users with a seamless experience. Here are the key APIs integrated into the project:

**OpenAI API(GPT-3.5)** : Utilized for Recipe Generation, the OpenAI API harnesses the power of natural language processing to generate personalized and diverse recipes based on user preferences. This advanced technology enhances the variety and customization of meal suggestions within the application.

**React-Vis**: While not a traditional API, React-Vis is a React library used for Data Visualization. It provides a set of responsive and interactive data visualization components, enhancing the user interface with visually appealing charts and graphs. This library ensures a clear and insightful representation of workout and nutrition data for users.

## Learning Goals

SQL and Go Backend: Gain proficiency in using PostgreSQL for data storage and leverage Go for building a robust backend infrastructure.
Data Persistence: Practice implementing effective data persistence strategies to ensure the integrity and reliability of user data.
JWT Authentication: Develop expertise in creating modern login sessions using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and efficient authentication.
